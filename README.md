## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How to make Tailwind CSS work in a Create React App application.
- How to apply the necessary styles using Tailwind CSS.
- That a property can be applied multiple times to the same component as long as they are defined in different breakpoints.

```html
<div className="bg-white p-6 sm:p-10 rounded-t-md">
```

- How to deploy the application to Vercel.

### Continued development

Next step is to research about Next.js and whether it would be useful provided my end goal of deploying an application to AWS.
I still have to figure out how to make smooth shadows around the borders. I still can see a right angle with the original background colour.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) - This helped understand Tailwind CSS enough to complete the challenge.
